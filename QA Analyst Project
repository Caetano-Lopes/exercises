I would ask why isn't the email field mandatory, otherwise how would the user accept the invite in case it isn't filled.Also If there is any system that doesnÂ´t allow users to be created with the same email (the same could apply to the first name + last name for example if you don't want agents with the same name in a CRM).Even though it can be obvious i would clarify where the Cancel button should redirect when clicked since it's not mentioned. I would clarify the lenght of all fields because they seem low, especially for the email and the lower limit of 6 can be problematic for names. Also would ask where is the email being displayed in the home page designs. Finally i would inquire what those 3 seconds for user creation are for, if the whole process or just the submission.
1 => Create a new user successfully under 3 seconds; 2=> Create a new user filling only mandatory fields; 3=> Create a new user with a first name length lower than 6 chars; 4=> Redirection of user creation should display email address, first name and last name on the home page; 5=> Change password of a temporary user successfully.
